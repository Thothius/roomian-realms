  <p>Before there was chaos, there was order. The Roomian lands were once a realm of harmony, watched over by divine beings of immense power. Then came The Shattering—a cosmic catastrophe that forever altered the fabric of reality. The Time Worm tore through the veil between worlds to devour the fruit of creation. In its wake, the gods themselves were broken, transformed, or scattered.</p>
  
  <div class="quote-block">
    "In the Roomian Realms, faith is not about salvation but survival. The gods themselves are wounded beings, as scarred and desperate as their followers."

          <strong>Before The Shattering:</strong> Aminion was a just and noble deity who protected the innocent and punished the wicked. The cosmic trauma of The Shattering corrupted his essence, transforming his sense of justice into a thirst for blood and violence.

          <strong>Before The Shattering:</strong> Athuri was a colossal amphibious entity whose upper body manifested as a forest canopy of intertwined branches and leaves, while his lower body was a vast network of coral reefs and underwater root systems.
