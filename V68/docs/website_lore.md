# The Shattered Pantheon

## The Cosmic Tragedy

When the Time Worm tore through reality to devour the fruit of creation, it left behind a broken world. The Shattering wasn't just a cataclysmâ€”it was divine trauma on a cosmic scale. Gods were broken, transformed, or scattered. Their followers, bound to their essence, were changed in kind.

What remains is a fractured pantheon of wounded deities and races desperately clinging to what remains of their patrons' power and wisdom.

## The Five Deities

### Aminion, The Blood Lord
Once a just deity, now corrupted into a god of blood and violence.
- **Followers**: Bloodelves who must consume blood to survive; Hellspawns who embody rage
- **Temple Offerings**: Human sacrifices (prisoners)
- **Temple Features**: Blood channels running through the floor to central ritual pools

### Athuri, The Verdant Tide
A dual-natured deity of forest and ocean who split himself to survive.
- **Followers**: Knowledge-preserving Froggians from his oceanic essence; Wild Hunt Satyrs from his woodland essence
- **Temple Offerings**: Food offerings
- **Temple Features**: Living plants and water features in perfect balance

### Crator, The Master Artificer
A god of order and craftsmanship trapped in his mountain fortress.
- **Followers**: Blue-skinned Finestorian craftsmen; bald Pasunka monks embodying stone
- **Temple Offerings**: Livestock offerings
- **Temple Features**: Perfect geometric patterns and displays of exceptional craftsmanship

### Shmalor, The Fractured Queen
A goddess of transformation shattered into countless fragments.
- **Followers**: Parasitic Wormlings; some Bloodelves drawn to transformation
- **Temple Offerings**: Human sacrifices (prisoners)
- **Temple Features**: Shifting architecture and disorienting mirrors

### The God Emperor, The Time Worm
The cosmic entity that caused The Shattering, not truly a god but something alien.
- **Followers**: Wormlings, who are fragments of its own essence
- **Temple Offerings**: Human sacrifices (prisoners)
- **Temple Features**: Non-Euclidean geometry and void altars

## The Unaligned: Northmen
Pragmatic humans with no direct divine connection, adapting through flexibility and opportunism. Their "Glory Hoards" of trophies serve as their spiritual focus.

## A World of Broken Gods and Desperate Followers

In Roomian Realms, faith is not about salvation but survival. The gods themselves are wounded beings, as scarred and desperate as their followers. This is not a world of clear heroes and villains, but of survivors adapting to divine catastrophe.

Will you embrace the broken divinity of this shattered world, or forge your own path like the pragmatic Northmen? The choice is yours in this rich, grimdark fantasy realm where gods bleed, forests and oceans mourn their separation, and worms dream of devouring creation.
