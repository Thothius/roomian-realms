            <h2>The Cosmic Tragedy</h2>
            <p>When the Time Worm tore through reality to devour the fruit of creation, it left behind a broken world. The Shattering wasn't just a cataclysm—it was divine trauma on a cosmic scale. Gods were broken, transformed, or scattered. Their followers, bound to their essence, were changed in kind.</p>
            <p>What remains is a fractured pantheon of wounded deities and races desperately clinging to what remains of their patrons' power and wisdom.</p>

            <h2>The Five Deities</h2>
            
            <div class="deity deity-aminion">
                <h3>Aminion, The Blood Lord</h3>
                <p>Once a just and noble deity, Aminion was corrupted during The Shattering, transformed into a cruel god obsessed with blood sacrifice. His temples accept human sacrifices (prisoners), feeding his insatiable hunger for violence.</p>
                <h4>Followers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bloodelves (Cantor)</strong> - Once beautiful elves who now bear a curse that requires them to consume blood to survive</li>
                    <li><strong>Hellspawns (Tilapi)</strong> - Formerly graceful humans transformed into embodiments of rage and cruelty</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Temple Features:</h4>
                <p>Dark sanctuaries with blood channels running through the floor, carrying sacrificial offerings to central pools where priests conduct elaborate rituals. The walls depict Aminion's transformation from benevolent deity to the Blood Lord.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="deity deity-athuri">
                <h3>Athuri, The Verdant Tide</h3>
                <p>Before The Shattering, Athuri was a dual-natured deity who embodied the harmony between land and sea. His form was that of a colossal amphibious entity whose upper body manifested as a forest canopy of intertwined branches and leaves, while his lower body was a vast network of coral reefs and underwater root systems. When the Time Worm tore through reality, he was caught at the boundary between worlds and split himself to preserve his essence. His temples accept food offerings.</p>
                <h4>Followers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Froggians (Q_Amevia)</strong> - Emerged from the waters where Athuri's oceanic essence dispersed, carrying ancient knowledge and wisdom</li>
                    <li><strong>Satyrs (Argonosh)</strong> - Born from the forest floor where Athuri's woodland essence took root, now slowly succumbing to corruption</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Temple Features:</h4>
                <p>Sanctuaries that seamlessly blend forest and aquatic elements, with living trees and plants growing alongside pools and flowing water. The central altar stands at the boundary between a small indoor forest and a clear pool, symbolizing the unity that was lost.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="deity deity-crator">
                <h3>Crator, The Master Artificer</h3>
                <p>The god of crafting and stonework, Crator alone among the gods survived The Shattering relatively unscathed, protected within his mountain fortress by ancient rune magic. He remains trapped there, guiding his followers through strict codexes of discipline. His temples accept livestock offerings.</p>
                <h4>Followers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finestorians (Dondorian)</strong> - Blue-skinned master craftsmen transformed by exposure to Crator's divine essence</li>
                    <li><strong>Pasunkas (Cretonian)</strong> - Bald monks practicing stone spiritualism, making themselves like stone both mentally and physically</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Temple Features:</h4>
                <p>Structures following strict geometric principles laid down by Crator himself, with every angle, proportion, and measurement precisely calculated. Displays of exceptional craftsmanship serve as both inspiration and teaching tools.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="deity deity-shmalor">
                <h3>Shmalor, The Fractured Queen</h3>
                <p>Once the goddess of transitions and metamorphosis, Shmalor's essence was shattered into countless fragments during The Shattering. Each fragment embodies a different aspect of her domain—decay, transformation, rebirth—but lacks the harmonious whole. Her temples accept human sacrifices (prisoners).</p>
                <h4>Followers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wormlings (Garthimi)</strong> - Parasitic entities connected to both Shmalor and the God Emperor</li>
                    <li><strong>Bloodelves (Cantor)</strong> - Some worship Shmalor alongside Aminion, drawn to her aspects of transformation</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Temple Features:</h4>
                <p>Architecture that seems to shift and change when not directly observed, with mirrors creating disorienting visual effects. Fractured mosaics depict Shmalor's shattering and the transformation of her followers.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="deity deity-emperor">
                <h3>The God Emperor, The Time Worm</h3>
                <p>The cosmic entity that caused The Shattering, the God Emperor is not truly a god but something far more alien—a vast worm-like being from beyond reality that devoured the fruit of creation. Fragments of its incomprehensible form were left behind, creating the Wormlings. His temples accept human sacrifices (prisoners).</p>
                <h4>Followers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wormlings (Garthimi)</strong> - Direct fragments of the God Emperor's essence, parasitic entities working to prepare for his return</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Temple Features:</h4>
                <p>Structures that deliberately defy conventional geometry, with angles that shift when not observed and shadows that move independently of light sources. Void altars serve as focal points for the God Emperor's influence.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="deity deity-northmen">
                <h3>The Unaligned: Northmen</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Northmen (Human)</strong> stand apart from the religious framework, having no direct connection to any of the major deities. When The Shattering occurred, their ancestors were simple tribal humans who survived by taking shelter in deep caves and mountain strongholds. Their pragmatic nature allowed them to adapt without the dramatic transformations experienced by other races.</p>
                <p>At the heart of Northmen culture lies the sacred tradition of the 'Glory Hoard'—a personal collection of trophies taken from defeated enemies and conquered lands. These hoards serve as their spiritual focus in place of dedicated deity worship.</p>
                <p>Northmen often adopt aspects of multiple religions, honoring whichever god seems most useful for their current endeavors—Crator for crafting, Athuri for hunting, sometimes even Aminion before battle. They generally avoid worship of Shmalor and the God Emperor, viewing these deities as too chaotic and dangerous.</p>

            <h2>A World of Broken Gods and Desperate Followers</h2>
            <p>In Roomian Realms, faith is not about salvation but survival. The gods themselves are wounded beings, as scarred and desperate as their followers. This is not a world of clear heroes and villains, but of survivors adapting to divine catastrophe.</p>
            <p>Will you embrace the broken divinity of this shattered world, or forge your own path like the pragmatic Northmen? The choice is yours in this rich, grimdark fantasy realm where gods bleed, forests and oceans mourn their separation, and worms dream of devouring creation.</p>
