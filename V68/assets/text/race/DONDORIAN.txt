DESC_LONG: "The Finestorians are a robust, powerfully-built people whose stocky frames and pronounced features belie their extraordinary dexterity and crafting precision. Standing shorter but broader than humans, they possess remarkable strength in their thick-muscled arms and barrel chests. Their skin exhibits subtle metallic hues—ranging from copper and bronze to iron and silver—that shift slightly with their emotional state. Their most distinctive features are their prominent brow ridges, deep-set eyes that glow faintly in darkness, and unusually dense bone structure that can withstand tremendous pressure.

Their society revolves around the 'Guild Clans'—extended family units organized by crafting specialties that form the backbone of their social structure. Each clan maintains ancestral techniques passed down through generations, with knowledge preserved in both oral traditions and intricate metal tablets inscribed with their unique pictographic writing system. Finestorian settlements are architectural marvels carved directly into mountainsides, featuring massive forge-temples at their centers where the most sacred crafting rituals take place. Their dwellings combine practical durability with artistic expression, every surface bearing meaningful geometric patterns and symbolic metalwork.

In warfare, Finestorians rely on superior equipment rather than numbers. Their master-crafted weapons and armor—often incorporating unique alloys unknown to other races—give them significant advantages in combat. They favor heavy axes and hammers that complement their natural strength, and their distinctive layered armor provides exceptional protection while maintaining mobility. Rather than elaborate tactics, they employ straightforward, methodical approaches to battle, relying on their endurance and crafting superiority to overcome adversaries.

Finestorians approach relationships with the same careful consideration they give their crafts. They form deep, lasting bonds built on mutual respect for skill and honest labor. While initially reserved with outsiders, they become fiercely loyal to those who demonstrate crafting aptitude or respect for their traditions. Their diplomatic interactions are direct and literal—they have little patience for political maneuvering or empty promises. A Finestorian's word is considered as binding as metal, and betrayal of trust is viewed as the gravest offense. As their proverb states: 'The mountain remembers what the river forgets.'",
