DESC_LONG: "Northmen are imposing figures with robust frames adorned with intricate jewelry that doubles as portable wealth. Their society is built upon competing trading clans, each led by merchant-warriors who have proven their worth through commercial prowess and political maneuvering.

Their culture revolves around commercial dominance, political ambition, and clan reputation. Their social hierarchy is fluid—any Northman can challenge for leadership by demonstrating superior trading skill or political cunning. This creates constant internal competition tempered by the need for unity against external threats.

In warfare, they combine brutal efficiency with calculated tactics. Their battle formations emphasize overwhelming force at critical points, with warriors competing for profitable conquests while maintaining tactical discipline. Their smiths create weapons designed for intimidation—massive axes and ornate swords that complement their strength.

They approach diplomacy as an extension of competition—alliances form based on mutual benefit and respect for cunning. Their word, once given in formal contract, is binding from the practical understanding that reputation affects future opportunities.",
