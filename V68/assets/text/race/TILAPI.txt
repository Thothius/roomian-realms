	DESC: "Born from the fires of the abyss, Hellspawns are demonic entities that embody chaos and destruction. Their skin ranges from deep crimson to obsidian black, often marked with glowing runes and adorned with bony protrusions. They thrive in extreme heat and draw power from darkness, making them formidable warriors who can channel agony into strength. Hellspawns respect power and pain in equal measure, forming blood pacts rather than traditional alliances.",

DESC_LONG: "Hellspawns are terrifying manifestations of Aminion's chaotic will, born during the cataclysmic period when the Fallen One was freed from his imprisonment. Their appearance varies widely—some resemble humanoids with crimson skin, twisted horns, and bat-like wings, while others take more monstrous forms with multiple limbs, exposed musculature, or bodies perpetually wreathed in ghostly fire. What unites them all is the unmistakable aura of dread they project, their brutish demeanor, and the supernatural resilience that allows them to endure conditions that would destroy most mortal beings.

Their society, if it can be called that, is built upon the 'Dominion Hierarchy'—a brutal system where authority is earned through displays of cruelty and strength, mirroring Aminion's own fall from grace and embrace of chaos. Those who can inflict the greatest pain and destruction rise to positions of power, with leadership constantly challenged through ritual combat in the 'Crucibles of Ascension'—arenas where aspirants battle not just their opponents but also summoned abyssal entities. Hellspawn settlements are architectural nightmares of crudely constructed obsidian spires, chains, and perpetually burning pyres that serve both as light sources and places of worship to Aminion. The air is thick with sulfurous fumes and the distant sounds of agony from countless slaves—a constant reminder of their cruel nature.

In warfare, Hellspawns are terrifying opponents who seem to draw strength from carnage and destruction, channeling Aminion's chaotic essence. Their fighting style is direct and brutal, relying on overwhelming force rather than finesse or strategy. They prefer heavy, devastating weapons designed to maximize suffering rather than deliver quick deaths—massive hammers, serrated blades, and spiked maces that tear flesh and prolong the victim's torment. Their primitive armor, forged in hellfire and quenched in the blood of sacrifices, is adorned with the preserved faces of worthy opponents. Most fearsome are the 'Soulforged Weapons'—terrible instruments of war that contain trapped spirits of powerful enemies, allowing the wielder to draw upon their strength and knowledge while subjecting the imprisoned soul to eternal torment.

Hellspawns approach diplomacy as an extension of intimidation—they respect only strength and submission. They harbor a deep hatred for all other races, viewing them as either threats to be destroyed or potential slaves to be broken. The sole exception to this hatred are the Bloodelves, whom they regard with a wary respect due to their shared devotion to Aminion and appreciation for suffering. As their ancient proverb states: 'Strength crushes, fire consumes, and the weak serve or perish.'"
