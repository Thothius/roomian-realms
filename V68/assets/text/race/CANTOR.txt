DESC_LONG: "The Bloodelves are elegant, pale-skinned immortals whose civilization thrives in the eternal twilight of ancient castles and shadowed valleys. Distinguished by their pointed ears and crimson eyes, these vampire-like beings move with uncanny silence and strike with deadly precision. Their slender frames belie supernatural strength and reflexes, while their enhanced senses allow them to perceive the flowing life essence beneath living skin, making them peerless hunters who never require sleep.

Their society revolves around the 'Crimson Court' - an intricate aristocracy where status is determined by bloodline purity, mastery of blood magic, and the number of slaves one possesses. Bloodelf architecture favors soaring spires, elaborate crypts, and grand halls designed for nocturnal gatherings, all adorned with stained glass that filters moonlight into mesmerizing patterns. Their dwellings lack bedchambers entirely, as they have evolved beyond the need for sleep, instead using these nighttime hours for study, ritual, and the careful draining of life essence from their carefully maintained stables of slaves.

Bloodelves reproduce at an exceptionally slow rate, with females capable of conception perhaps once a century. This biological limitation has shaped their entire culture, making them fiercely protective of their young and obsessively focused on extending their already considerable lifespans through the consumption of life essence. The draining process, when performed with skill, allows a Bloodelf to sustain themselves while keeping their slaves alive for decades—a practice they consider both practical and merciful compared to the crude bloodletting of lesser vampire species.

In warfare, Bloodelves excel at stealth, archery, and psychological manipulation. Their archers can strike with supernatural accuracy even in complete darkness, their arrows often enchanted with blood magic that drains vitality from victims. Rather than overwhelming force, they prefer to isolate targets through misdirection and fear, striking when enemies are most vulnerable. Their legendary patience, honed through centuries of sleepless nights, allows them to orchestrate elaborate stratagems spanning decades or even centuries.

Bloodelves approach relationships as carefully cultivated investments, with a clear hierarchy between themselves and the lesser beings they consider worthy only of servitude. They maintain networks of informants, vassals, and carefully selected slaves, each relationship precisely managed for maximum benefit and longevity of essence extraction. While capable of genuine loyalty to those who earn their respect, their immortal perspective makes them view most alliances as temporary arrangements. Their diplomatic corps employs blood-oaths that magically bind parties to agreements, with severe consequences for betrayal. Despite their predatory nature, they prefer sustainable relationships over wasteful violence, seeing themselves as refined caretakers rather than mindless monsters—the inevitable apex predators in a world of lesser beings.",
