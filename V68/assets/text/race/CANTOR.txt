DESC_LONG: "The Bloodelves are an ancient race of aristocratic predators whose civilization is built upon the twin pillars of blood magic and ruthless domination. Their alabaster skin and crimson eyes mark them as beings touched by Aminion's power, while their tall, slender forms move with an unnerving grace that betrays their supernatural origins. Bloodelves age at one-seventh the rate of humans, with lifespans extending several centuries—but only if they regularly consume the life essence of others. Without this vital sustenance, they succumb to "The Withering"—a horrific process where their immortal bodies rapidly deteriorate, skin cracking like ancient parchment before their desiccated forms collapse into dust. Their architecture reflects this obsession with permanence, with sprawling estates of black marble and crimson glass designed to last millennia, often incorporating torture chambers and blood collection facilities disguised as elegant bathhouses and dining halls.

At the heart of Bloodelf society lies the Crimson Court—a labyrinthine political structure where noble houses compete for influence through a complex dance of assassination, betrayal, and calculated cruelty. Within this cutthroat environment, devotion to both Aminion and Shmalor defines the most successful houses. The primary worship of Aminion grants them mastery over blood magic and the power to dominate others, while their secondary reverence for Shmalor provides the cunning to wield that power effectively. The "Crimson Covenant," the inner circle of the Court, comprises those who have demonstrated the most efficient methods of blood extraction and slave management, their expertise used to further Aminion's agenda of domination and suffering.

Bloodelf aristocrats maintain vast "blood farms" where captives from other races are kept in varying states of consciousness, their life essence methodically drained to the precise point before death, then allowed to recover just enough to be harvested again. The most prized slaves are those with exceptional vitality or unique blood properties—Froggians for their regenerative capabilities, Satyrs for their connection to natural energies, and occasionally even fellow Bloodelves who have fallen from grace. These unfortunate souls are kept in specialized facilities called "Vitae Gardens," where they hang suspended in elaborate contraptions designed to maximize blood flow and minimize resistance. The sight of these gardens—with hundreds of bodies arranged in concentric circles around central collection basins—is considered an aesthetic triumph among the Bloodelf nobility.

The most prestigious political advisors in Bloodelf society are those who have demonstrated mastery of their dual worship system—using Aminion's power to extract maximum life essence from their slaves while applying Shmalor's cunning to avoid wasteful deaths. These advisors often carry ornate blood vials as symbols of their office, using them in elaborate ceremonies where they symbolically drink the essence of their enemies to demonstrate dominance. The most successful noble houses maintain private blood sanctums within their estates, with Aminion's altar—a basin of perpetually flowing blood—always positioned as the centerpiece of their unholy rituals.

The core of Bloodelf religion is encapsulated in their saying: "Through blood we endure, through suffering we rule." This dual worship is not seen as contradictory but complementary—Aminion's blood magic provides the immortality that fuels their society, while Shmalor's teachings on adaptability and opportunity guide how that power is deployed. In the complex political landscape of the Crimson Court, mere cruelty is insufficient; knowing precisely how to inflict maximum suffering while preserving one's resources makes the difference between ascension and destruction.

The most sacred Bloodelf ritual is the "Crimson Communion," where initiates simultaneously drain multiple victims to the point of death, absorbing not only their blood but fragments of their souls. During these ceremonies, the high priests first invoke Aminion with the words "By blood we conquer death" before turning to Shmalor with "By suffering we master life." This ritual symbolizes the perfect balance between their two patron deities and is considered the pinnacle of Bloodelf religious practice. Those who survive the ritual gain enhanced powers and a temporary reprieve from The Withering, their bodies rejuvenated by the massive influx of life energy.

Bloodelf children are taught the "Doctrine of Necessary Cruelty" alongside their lessons in etiquette and blood magic. These teachings emphasize that mercy is the true evil, as it denies both the superior being their rightful sustenance and the inferior being their purpose as vessels of life energy. Young Bloodelves who show particular aptitude for efficient blood extraction are sometimes selected for special mentorship by members of the Crimson Covenant, who train them in the art of prolonging suffering to maximize the quality of harvested blood while minimizing resource expenditure.

In warfare, Bloodelf commanders employ strategies that reflect their dual worship—using Aminion's blood magic for raw destructive power while applying Shmalor's principles of deception and strategic cruelty. Their military doctrine emphasizes capturing rather than killing enemies whenever possible, as living prisoners represent valuable resources rather than mere victories. Their infamous "Blood Legions" are accompanied by mobile extraction units that process captured enemies on the battlefield, fueling the Bloodelf warriors with fresh vitality that makes them nearly unstoppable in prolonged conflicts.

The highest echelons of Bloodelf society practice what they call "The Eternal Game"—political strategies that may take decades or even centuries to come to fruition. This approach takes advantage of their extended lifespans to outmaneuver shorter-lived races who cannot maintain consistent political direction across generations. Bloodelves who successfully complete century-spanning schemes are honored with the title "Deathless Lord," indicating their mastery of both Aminion's power and Shmalor's cunning—and their success in staving off The Withering through particularly efficient blood-harvesting operations.

Bloodelves reproduce at an exceptionally slow rate, with females capable of conception perhaps once a century. This biological limitation has shaped their entire culture, making them fiercely protective of their young and obsessively focused on extending their already considerable lifespans through the consumption of life essence—a practice blessed by Aminion himself. The most ancient Bloodelves, those who have survived for millennia through careful blood consumption, develop a crystalline quality to their skin and eyes that marks them as "The Undying"—beings who have so thoroughly mastered the extraction of life essence that they have transcended the normal limitations of their kind.

In warfare, Bloodelves excel at stealth, archery, and psychological manipulation. Their archers can strike with supernatural accuracy even in complete darkness, their arrows often enchanted with blood magic that drains vitality from victims. Rather than overwhelming force, they prefer to isolate targets through misdirection and fear, striking when enemies are most vulnerable. Their legendary patience, honed through centuries of sleepless nights, allows them to orchestrate elaborate stratagems spanning decades or even centuries. The most feared Bloodelf generals are those who have mastered the perfect balance between Aminion's destructive power and Shmalor's strategic cunning, their armies leaving not corpses but desiccated husks in their wake.

Bloodelves approach relationships as carefully cultivated investments, with a clear hierarchy between themselves and the lesser beings they consider worthy only of servitude. They maintain networks of informants, vassals, and carefully selected slaves, each relationship precisely managed for maximum benefit and longevity of essence extraction. While capable of genuine loyalty to those who earn their respect, their immortal perspective makes them view most alliances as temporary arrangements. Their diplomatic corps employs blood-oaths that magically bind parties to agreements, with severe consequences for betrayal. Despite their predatory nature, they prefer sustainable relationships over wasteful violence, seeing themselves as refined caretakers rather than mindless monsters—the inevitable apex predators in a world of lesser beings.
