DESC_LONG: "Pasunkas are lithe beings whose skin bears subtle luminescent patterns that pulse with their heartbeat. Their amber or violet eyes perceive beyond the physical realm, sensing spiritual disturbances others cannot detect.

Their society is structured around the 'Three Pillars of Transcendence': spiritual cultivation, martial mastery, and physical strength. Settlements follow precise geometric principles to channel natural energy flows, with Forest Temples serving as meditation halls for communing with ancestral spirits.

Pasunka spiritual practices involve rigorous self-discipline centered around physical training. Young initiates undergo the 'Thousand Pushup Path' ritual, learning to transmute physical exertion into spiritual energy. Their combat philosophy teaches that mastery comes from understanding both inner peace and outer strength.

In warfare, they are methodical and precise, viewing combat as a spiritual exercise. Their 'Forest Wind' fighting style emphasizes economy of movement and leveraging an opponent's energy against them. Rather than armor, they rely on positioning and chi manipulation to avoid attacks.",
