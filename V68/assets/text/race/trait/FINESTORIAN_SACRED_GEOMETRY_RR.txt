NAME: "Sacred Geometry",
TITLE: "Crator's Patterns",
DESC: "This Finestorian perceives the mathematical underpinnings of reality with unusual clarity, their mind attuned to the sacred geometric patterns that form the foundation of Crator's creation.",

BIO_DESC: [
	"When {NAME} studies architectural plans, observers report seeing faint luminous lines extending from {HIS} eyes, tracing perfect geometric forms that reveal hidden structural relationships.",
	"It is said that {NAME} can instantly calculate load-bearing capacities, stress points, and resonance patterns of any structure with a precision that defies conventional engineering methods.",
	"During moments of deep concentration, {NAME} sometimes sketches complex geometric patterns that appear meaningless to others but later prove to predict structural failures or optimal design solutions.",
	"Those who study under {NAME} often report dreams filled with impossible architecture and non-Euclidean spaces, their minds struggling to process the geometric insights {HE} has awakened in them.",
	"The Crator geometry-priests believe that pattern-blessed individuals like {NAME} perceive echoes of the original divine blueprint from which all physical reality was constructed.",
