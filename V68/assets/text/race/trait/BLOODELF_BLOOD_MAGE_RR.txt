FLAVOUR: [
    "Blood magic represents the pinnacle of Bloodelf mystical tradition, transforming their natural affinity for blood into a sophisticated magical system that other races can only crudely imitate.",
    "While outsiders view blood magic with horror, Bloodelves see it as their sacred birthright—a gift from Aminion that allows them to transcend ordinary limitations through willing sacrifice.",
    "The most accomplished blood mages like {NAME} can perform feats that seem impossible: healing mortal wounds, temporarily enhancing physical abilities beyond natural limits, or even briefly perceiving future possibilities.",
    "Some blood mages develop a dual devotion to both Aminion and Shmalor, using the Crimson Mirror ritual to access deeper cosmic insights through their hemomantic practices.",
    "The power wielded by blood mages comes at a price—years of exposure to blood magic leaves subtle alterations in their own blood, creating a distinctive resonance that other blood mages can immediately recognize.",
