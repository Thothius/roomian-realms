    "The shadow dancing tradition among Bloodelves dates back to the earliest days after The Shattering, when their ancestors needed to move unseen among more numerous and hostile races.",

    "Shadow dancers like {NAME} are often employed as assassins and spies, but they also serve important ceremonial roles in Aminion's most sacred and secret rituals.",
