    "Other Wormlings treat {NAME} with special reverence during breeding periods, recognizing that {HIS} accelerated reproduction represents the colony's most direct path to fulfilling the God Emperor's vision of a transformed Roomia.",
    "{NAME} describes the reproductive process as a sacred communion with both Shmalor's void and the God Emperor's realm beyond, temporarily accessing energies from beyond conventional reality to fuel the creation of new life.",
    "The breeding chambers where {NAME} produces offspring develop unusual spatial properties over time—objects might seem larger on the inside than outside, and visitors report brief sensations of existing in multiple places simultaneously.",

FLAVOUR: [
    "The accelerated reproduction displayed by Wormlings like {NAME} represents the most direct fulfillment of their purpose in Roomia—to multiply and spread the God Emperor's influence through vessels that contain fragments of the deity's essence.",
    "While other races reproduce primarily to continue their bloodlines, Rapid Breeders understand their reproduction as a sacred act of creation that advances the God Emperor's plan for Roomia's eventual transformation.",

    "In Wormling society, Rapid Breeders hold positions of special honor, their enhanced connection to both Shmalor's void and the God Emperor's extradimensional influence making them essential to the colony's growth and the advancement of the deity's plan.",
    "Some theologians believe that the accelerated reproduction of certain Wormlings represents a response to the God Emperor's call for more vessels, the deity's consciousness gradually preparing for a more complete return to Roomia through the continued expansion of The Breach and the multiplication of suitable hosts.",
