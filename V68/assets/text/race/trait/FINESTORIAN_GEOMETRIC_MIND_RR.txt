NAME: "Geometric Mind",
TITLE: "Pattern Perceiver",
DESC: "This Finestorian's consciousness operates according to the sacred mathematics of Crator, their thoughts flowing through perfect geometric structures that reveal the hidden order of reality.",

BIO_DESC: [
	"When {NAME} concentrates on complex problems, faint geometric patterns can be seen moving beneath {HIS} skin, as if {HIS} very flesh reconfigures to facilitate mathematical thinking.",
	"It is said that {NAME} dreams exclusively in perfect geometric forms, each night's rest revealing new mathematical relationships that {HE} meticulously documents upon waking.",
	"During moments of intellectual insight, those near {NAME} report briefly seeing the world as intersecting planes and perfect solids, a momentary glimpse into {HIS} perception.",
	"Those who engage {NAME} in mathematical discussions often find themselves unable to sleep afterward, their minds racing with glimpses of patterns too perfect to forget yet too complex to fully comprehend.",
	"The Finestorian scholars believe that geometric minds like {NAME}'s exist partially in Crator's realm of perfect forms, their consciousness able to perceive the mathematical underpinnings of creation itself.",
