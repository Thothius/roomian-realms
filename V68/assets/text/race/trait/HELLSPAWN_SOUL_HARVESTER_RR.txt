FLAVOUR: [
    "The soul harvesting practiced by Hellspawn like {NAME} represents one of Aminion's most controversial gifts, allowing his followers to directly consume the vital essence that other deities claim for their afterlife realms.",
    "While death is typically seen as the end of a being's worldly influence, Soul Harvesters ensure that the energy and experience of the deceased continue to serve Aminion's purposes through their consumption.",

    "Some theologians believe that the most powerful Soul Harvesters are gradually accumulating a collective consciousness comprised of fragments from thousands of consumed essences, their minds evolving toward a composite entity that embodies Aminion's vision of transcendent chaos.",
