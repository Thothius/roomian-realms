    "Other Wormlings approach {NAME} with a mixture of reverence and caution, recognizing that {HIS} connection to the God Emperor's realm beyond reality grants {HIM} knowledge that is both precious and potentially dangerous.",
    "{NAME} struggles to translate {HIS} cosmic memories into language comprehensible to others, often resorting to creating strange geometric diagrams or composing music that somehow conveys concepts conventional communication cannot express.",

FLAVOUR: [
    "The cosmic memories experienced by Wormlings like {NAME} represent fragments of the God Emperor's own consciousness, implanted during The Shattering when the alien entity first entered Roomia through The Breach created by Shmalor's death.",
    "While other beings perceive reality through the limited lens of three-dimensional space and linear time, those with Cosmic Memory occasionally glimpse the true nature of existence as understood by the God Emperor—a complex multidimensional tapestry where past, present, and future exist simultaneously.",
    "The disturbing visions that plague {NAME} stem from the fundamental incompatibility between the God Emperor's extradimensional consciousness and the limited neurological architecture of physical beings, creating a form of cosmic dissonance that manifests as prophetic insight.",
    "In Wormling society, those with Cosmic Memory serve as oracles and visionaries, their connection to both Shmalor's void and the God Emperor's realm beyond making them essential guides for the community's spiritual evolution toward eventual transcendence.",
    "Some theologians believe that Cosmic Memory represents the most direct evidence of the Wormlings' ultimate purpose—to serve as vessels for fragments of the God Emperor's consciousness, gradually preparing Roomia for the deity's eventual full return through the continued expansion of The Breach.",
