	TEXT: "The Temple of Crator venerates the Divine Architect, foremost creator among the Astari, who shaped the physical world and its many creatures. Crator's temples celebrate craftsmanship, discipline, and the perfection of form, reflecting his role as the master craftsman of reality. Crator's sanctuaries are marvels of architectural precision, where every stone, beam, and ornament is placed according to sacred geometric principles. Offerings of livestock are made upon perfectly balanced stone altars, symbolizing Crator's appreciation for well-crafted living forms. The temples themselves serve as working forges and training grounds, where devotees hone their crafts and physical disciplines as acts of worship.",
