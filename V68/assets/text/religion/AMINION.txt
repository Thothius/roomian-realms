	TEXT: "The Temple of Aminion venerates the Fallen One, Lord of Chaos, who rebelled against the cosmic order. Once a powerful Astari, Aminion sought to remake reality in his own image, believing that true power comes through embracing pain and chaos. Followers of Aminion practice ritual scarification and blood offerings, believing that through submission to suffering, one transcends mortal limitations. The temple's inner sanctum is adorned with implements of torture and sacrifice, each meticulously crafted to inflict precise forms of pain that are said to open pathways to Aminion's realm. The Hellspawns are Aminion's most devoted followers, embodying his teachings through their \"Pain's Embrace\" philosophy. Their bodies bear elaborate ritual scars that channel Aminion's chaotic energies, granting them supernatural strength in battle.",
