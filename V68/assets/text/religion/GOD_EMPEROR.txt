NAME: "Temple of the God Emperor",
NAMES: "Temples of the God Emperor",
DESC: "The Temple of the God Emperor honors the ancient entity from beyond reality that tore through the fabric of existence during The Shattering. Unlike other deities who were once gods of Roomia before being transformed, the God Emperor is an alien presence that exists primarily in the void between dimensions, with only fragments of its consciousness present in this reality.

The temples are unsettling structures built around void breaches - places where reality remains thin and unstable. These buildings feature impossible geometries that seem to shift when not directly observed, and chambers where gravity and time function differently. The central sanctum always contains a void breach, stabilized by strange machinery that pulses with otherworldly energies, allowing the God Emperor's influence to seep into Roomia.

The Wormlings are the God Emperor's only true worshippers, as they themselves are fragments of its essence that were left behind during its passage through Roomia. Each Wormling contains a tiny spark of the God Emperor's consciousness, allowing them to perceive multiple realities simultaneously and manipulate void energies. Their parasitic nature mirrors the God Emperor's relationship with reality itself - consuming and transforming rather than creating anew.

The highest-ranking priests, known as Void Speakers, undergo a transformation called 'The Merging,' where their bodies and minds are partially subsumed into the void. This grants them incredible powers but at the cost of their individuality and connection to physical reality. They speak with multiple voices and perceive time non-linearly, making their prophecies cryptic but uncannily accurate.

The most sacred ritual is the Void Communion, performed at seemingly random intervals determined by the alignment of void energies. During these ceremonies, Wormlings gather around the central breach and enter a collective trance state, their consciousness temporarily merging with fragments of the God Emperor beyond our reality. Those who witness these rituals describe the Wormlings moving in perfect unison while speaking in languages that should be physically impossible for their vocal structures to produce. The air itself seems to ripple and distort during these communions, and observers often report experiencing time differently - minutes stretching into hours or hours passing in what feels like seconds.

The ultimate goal of the God Emperor's worship is not salvation or destruction but transcendence - the preparation of Roomia for the God Emperor's eventual return, which they believe will transform the world into something beyond current understanding. This is neither seen as an apocalypse nor a golden age, but simply the next inevitable stage in the evolution of reality.",
