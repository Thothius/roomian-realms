	TEXT: "The Temple of Shmalor honors the Queen of the Agonosh, who represents the cosmic void and the spaces between realities. Slain by the Tilapi chieftain Trinduri during the first war of the gods, Shmalor's death is believed to have torn the veil between dimensions, allowing alien entities to enter the world of Syx. Shmalor's temples are unsettling places of shadow and whispers, where the boundaries between worlds seem to thin. Unlike other temples, they often appear larger inside than their exterior suggests, with corridors that seem to bend in impossible ways. The Wormlings are Shmalor's primary devotees, serving as living conduits for \"The Breach\"â€”the dimensional rift created by Shmalor's death. Their parasitic nature is considered a sacred manifestation of Shmalor's ability to transcend normal physical limitations.",
