	NAME: "Temple of Shmalor",
	CATEGORY: "Religion",
	TEXT: "The Temple of Shmalor honors the Trickster of the Astari, master of cunning, deception, and opportunity. Neither wholly good nor evil, Shmalor embodies the grey areas of morality and the unexpected twists of fate. Shmalor's temples are architecturally unpredictable, often incorporating optical illusions, secret passages, and rooms that seem to change their layout between visits. The Northmen are among Shmalor's most devoted followers, seeing in the deity a reflection of their own values of cleverness in trade and negotiation. Bloodelves also revere Shmalor for the deity's immortal perspective and mastery of manipulation, incorporating aspects of Shmalor's teachings into their political maneuvering within the Crimson Court. Worshippers believe Shmalor grants them the ability to see opportunities others miss and find unexpected solutions to seemingly impossible problems.",
