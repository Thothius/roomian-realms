	NAME: "Temple of Athuri",
	CATEGORY: "Religion",
	TEXT: "The Temple of Athuri honors the Leader and Greatest of the Astari, who embodies wisdom, harmony, and the natural order of the cosmos. Athuri Astari defeated his brother Bardok in both cosmic wars, establishing balance in the world and ensuring the continuation of life's sacred cycles. Athuri's temples are places of meditation, learning, and communion with nature. They feature open-air sanctuaries where sunlight and moonlight freely enter, symbolizing Athuri's omnipresent wisdom. Offerings of food are placed upon living altars—great stone tables entwined with flowering vines that change with the seasons, representing the eternal cycle of growth and renewal that Athuri protects. Worshippers believe Athuri grants them 'Harmony'—an enhanced connection to natural cycles that provides practical benefits in agriculture, medicine, and ecological awareness.",
