# Religious Conflicts in Roomian Realms

## The Eternal Struggle (Athuri vs. Aminion)
The most ancient and fundamental religious conflict in Roomia is between the followers of Athuri and Aminion. This struggle represents the cosmic battle between order and chaos, creation and destruction, harmony and discord.

### Manifestations:
- **Border Temples:** In regions where territories of Satyrs/Froggians and Hellspawns/Bloodelves meet, temples often become fortified structures with both religious and military significance.
- **The Purification Crusades:** Periodically, zealous followers of Athuri launch campaigns to "cleanse" areas they believe have been corrupted by Aminion's influence. These crusades are particularly intense after natural disasters, which Athuri's followers interpret as signs of cosmic imbalance caused by Aminion's followers.
- **The Crimson Infiltration:** Aminion's followers practice subtle infiltration of Athuri-dominated societies, establishing underground cults that slowly corrupt from within. They target disillusioned individuals who feel restricted by Athuri's emphasis on harmony and natural order.
- **Diplomatic Impossibility:** Representatives of these faiths cannot participate in joint religious ceremonies, making multi-faith diplomatic initiatives particularly challenging in regions where both religions have significant presence.

## The Innovation Dispute (Crator vs. Shmalor)
A more nuanced conflict exists between followers of Crator and Shmalor, representing the tension between structured creation and opportunistic adaptation.

### Manifestations:
- **Architectural Rivalries:** In cities where both deities are worshipped, temple construction becomes a competitive display. Crator's temples showcase perfect geometric precision and stability, while Shmalor's temples incorporate illusions and unexpected elements that seem to defy architectural logic.
- **Guild Tensions:** Craftsmen's guilds dedicated to Crator view Shmalor-worshipping merchants with suspicion, believing they profit from others' labor without contributing to creation. Conversely, merchants see the craftsmen as rigid and unable to adapt to market demands.
- **The Northmen's Balance:** The Northmen's dual worship system creates internal societal tension, with some factions favoring Crator's disciplined approach and others embracing Shmalor's opportunism. This division often splits along generational lines, with established elders favoring Crator and ambitious youth turning to Shmalor.
- **Innovation Debates:** Philosophical disputes arise over the nature of true innovationâ€”is it the result of disciplined application of established principles (Crator) or the unexpected connections made through adaptive thinking (Shmalor)?

## The Alien Intrusion (Traditional Deities vs. God Emperor)
The newest and perhaps most existential religious conflict involves the traditional deities (Athuri, Crator, Aminion, and Shmalor) against the alien influence of the God Emperor.

### Manifestations:
- **Void Containment:** Priests of the traditional religions occasionally form temporary alliances to contain void breaches associated with the God Emperor, seeing them as threats to the fabric of reality itself.
- **Wormling Persecution:** In regions dominated by traditional religions, Wormlings face systematic persecution, with their temples destroyed and colonies forced underground or to the fringes of society.
- **Prophetic Warnings:** Prophets of traditional religions speak of apocalyptic visions where the God Emperor's return transforms reality beyond recognition, erasing the influence of all other deities.
- **Conversion Anxiety:** Traditional religious authorities are particularly concerned about converts to the God Emperor's worship, seeing them as not merely changing faith but becoming alien to humanity itself through their connection to the void.

## The Blood and Cunning Alliance (Aminion and Shmalor)
While not a conflict, the unique alliance between aspects of Aminion's and Shmalor's worship among the Bloodelves creates tensions with more orthodox followers of both religions.

### Manifestations:
- **Heresy Accusations:** Orthodox followers of Aminion (primarily Hellspawns) view the Bloodelves' dual worship as diluting the purity of Aminion's teachings about embracing pain and chaos.
- **Trust Issues:** Pure Shmalor worshippers (primarily Northmen) are wary of Bloodelves, believing their blood rituals to Aminion compromise the clear thinking necessary for Shmalor's strategic insights.
- **Syncretic Evangelism:** Some Bloodelf religious leaders actively promote their dual worship system to other races, creating religious innovation that traditional authorities of both faiths view as dangerous.
- **Political Advantage:** The Bloodelves leverage this religious tension to their advantage, positioning themselves as sophisticated theological innovators while dismissing single-deity worshippers as primitive and limited in their understanding.

## The Creation Hierarchy Dispute (Crator and Athuri)
A subtle theological dispute exists between followers of Crator and Athuri regarding which deity's creative domain takes precedence.

### Manifestations:
- **Natural vs. Artificial:** Athuri's followers emphasize that natural creation precedes and enables artificial creation, while Crator's followers argue that the ability to transform natural materials represents a higher form of creation.
- **Ecological Tensions:** Crator-worshipping societies tend to modify landscapes extensively for resource extraction and construction, creating friction with Athuri-worshipping communities who prioritize natural harmony.
- **Healing Methodologies:** Medical practitioners who follow Athuri emphasize natural remedies and allowing the body's inherent healing abilities to work, while Crator's followers develop surgical techniques and medical devices that actively intervene in the healing process.
- **Educational Philosophy:** Schools in Athuri-dominated regions teach through observation and harmony with natural processes, while Crator-influenced education emphasizes structured learning and the mastery of specific techniques.

## Local Religious Conflicts

### The Northlands Schism
In the Northmen territories, a growing religious movement seeks to elevate Shmalor above Crator as the primary deity, arguing that in harsh northern conditions, adaptability and opportunism (Shmalor's domains) are more valuable than rigid craftsmanship (Crator's domain). This has created tensions within Northmen society, with traditional shipbuilding clans remaining loyal to Crator while trading families increasingly embrace Shmalor exclusively.

### The Bloodelf Court Factions
Within the Bloodelf Crimson Court, religious affiliation has become a marker of political alignment. The "Crimson Purists" maintain exclusive devotion to Aminion, emphasizing raw power and traditional blood rituals. The "Silver Mirror Faction" promotes the dual worship of Aminion and Shmalor, advocating for strategic application of power. A third, smaller faction known as the "Void Seekers" has begun exploring connections with the God Emperor, creating significant alarm among both traditional factions.

### The Wormling Splinter Cults
Not all Wormlings maintain exclusive devotion to the God Emperor. Small splinter colonies have emerged that attempt to worship aspects of Shmalor alongside the God Emperor, creating hybrid rituals that combine void communion with strategic divination. These splinter colonies face persecution from mainstream Wormling society, which views such syncretism as diluting the purity of their connection to the God Emperor.

### The Finestorian Orthodoxy Movement
Among the Finestorians, a conservative religious movement has emerged that seeks to "purify" Crator worship by eliminating influences from other deities. This movement has created tensions with merchant guilds and diplomatic corps who necessarily interact with worshippers of other deities, particularly Shmalor-worshipping Northmen traders.
