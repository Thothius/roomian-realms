	TEXT: "The God Emperor is not a remnant of The Shattering but its cause - the Time Worm itself, an ancient entity that exists beyond conventional reality, moving between dimensions like a worm through soil. When it passed through Roomia a thousand years ago, drawn by the cosmic fruit of Athuri's world tree, it tore the fabric of existence, killing the old gods and forever altering the world.

The Wormlings are not native to Roomia but came through the void breaches created by the God Emperor's passage. They are fragments of the God Emperor's own essence, left behind like offspring to adapt to this world. Each Wormling contains a tiny spark of the God Emperor's consciousness, allowing them to perceive multiple realities simultaneously and manipulate void energies. Their parasitic nature mirrors the God Emperor's relationship with reality itself - consuming and transforming rather than creating anew.

The Wormlings have a short lifespan and require new hosts to survive, constantly breeding and adapting to maintain their presence in Roomia. The God Emperor is said to grant power to one special Wormling who rules the brood and is granted immortality to lead the otherwise fleeting Wormling organisms. This chosen one serves as the living voice of the God Emperor in Roomia.

The appearance of Void Ore throughout Roomia is a direct consequence of the God Emperor's passage, as its movement through reality left tears in the fabric of existence. The Wormlings, with their innate connection to the void, are uniquely suited to mining and refining this strange material, which holds the power to bend and reshape reality itself. Their knowledge of void technology has made them valuable despite being feared and distrusted by other races.

The Void Communion is exclusive to Wormlings, who understand that the God Emperor is neither benevolent nor malevolent but simply exists beyond such concepts. They do not worship it out of love or fear but out of recognition that they are extensions of its being. Their temples are built around void breaches, places where reality remains thin and unstable. These structures serve to stabilize and expand the breaches, allowing more of the God Emperor's influence to seep into Roomia.

The highest-ranking priests, known as Void Speakers, undergo a transformation called 'The Merging,' where their bodies and minds are partially subsumed into the void. This grants them incredible powers but at the cost of their individuality and connection to physical reality. They speak with multiple voices and perceive time non-linearly, making their prophecies cryptic but uncannily accurate.

The ultimate goal of the Void Communion is to prepare Roomia for the God Emperor's return, which they believe will transform the world into something beyond current understanding - neither destruction nor salvation, but transcendence into a higher state of existence. The shattered status quo of the realms is merely the first stage in a greater transformation that will culminate when the Time Worm completes its cosmic cycle and returns to consume what remains.",
