	"The air is too dry. More humidifiers would solve that quickly.",
	"We need more humidifiers in our {RACE_CITY}. Not only do they keep the air moist, they are also really neat-looking. I could stare at them pulsating for hours.",
	"The hive lacks a certain Garthimi flair. I think other species describe it as 'a dreadful humid haze permeating everything, madness-inducing growths pulsing irregularly to unheard alien rhythm causing hardened soldiers to flee rather than descend further into the maw of the hive to end the evil' or something. I think it lacks that cozy feeling.",
	"The city should reflect our purpose. More reminders of what happens to our enemies are needed around here. We want more dread.",
	"I hear the more squeamish slaves are easily cowed by reminding them of the consequences of disobedience. Make them dread resisting us.",
