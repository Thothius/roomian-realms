		TEXT: "Here subjects will train to become soldiers. You manually set target level of your soldiers and they will train to reach that level. A level one soldier takes one day to train,	and his training level will maintain for 5 years before he will have to be retrained. A level 15 soldier needs to train every day to keep his skill. Soldiers with a level of 1 or above will be deployable	in battle. You also set the target amount of battlegear that your soldiers will use, as well as soldier race and minimum experience.",
