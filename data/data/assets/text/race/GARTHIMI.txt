DESC: 
"Garthimi love death and destruction while caring little for the finer things in life. High reproductive rate makes them perfect cannon fodder, but given the right training and equipment, they can become quite proficient.  Their ability to raise cavern Balticrawlers gives ample food to feed their hive.  They require humidifiers to reach an ideal environment."
",
DESC_LONG:
"Garthimi were created by the fallen god Aminon in the first war of the gods. After his imprisonment, the Garthimi retreated to the mountain caverns of the world where they raided the ones foolish enough to settle nearby. They reproduce naturally in hatcheries and their exoskeleton is quite resistant to all kinds of weather, while also providing them with a natural battle boost. They like fish and meat.
