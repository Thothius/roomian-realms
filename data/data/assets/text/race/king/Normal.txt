	"{PLAYER_FACTION_RULER}, what happened to us? Once the best of {RACE_SELVES}, now complete strangers! Every night I shed a tear, looking at the portrait of you you sent me. It is time for us to go our separate ways. Maybe one day, we can find our way back to each other.",

	"{PLAYER_FACTION_RULER}, how are you old chap? I wish I could say that I was doing well, but alas, misfortune has struck my kingdom, and I'm being blackmailed by this bandit called 'Krull'. I beg your assistance so that I can pay off this scum and save my realm from devastation. Please spare what you can.",
	"Esteemed colleague {PLAYER_FACTION_RULER} of {PLAYER_FACTION}. It seems that in your haste to build your city, you forgot my birthday.

	"Dear subject. I don't remember your name, but your yearly taxes are due. Pay up or face my wrath!",
