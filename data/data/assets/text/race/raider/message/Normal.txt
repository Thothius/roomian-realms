HELP: [
	"Hey Neighbour! I have some guy here at my border, claiming to know you. {HEC} is a {RACE_SELF}, and goes by the name of '{RAIDER_NAME}'. Looks kind of funny if you ask me. He says you owe him stuff, and I promised to mediate. Here's the list.",
	"{RACE_HELLO}, my dear {RACE_LORD}. I've been instructed to convey this message here from a certain '{RAIDER_NAME}', that has come to visit. I quote: 'Give me my stuff, you ugly, terrible person, or I'll come over there and make a hat out of your genitals.' That is all. There's a list with {HIS} demands here, I'll pay {HIM} for you.",
],

HELP_DESTROYED: [
	"Hey, you little {RACE_INSULT} you. You won't believe what just happened. I was passing through your neighbouring {FACTION_RACE_LORD}, and by accident they, and their whole army tripped and impaled themselves on my men's sword!. In fact, the little {FACTION_RACE_LORD} fell so hard that their head came off and landed on a spike on top of my tent. Can you believe that? All this commotion collapsed the whole realm. Well, well, what can you do, shit happens. I thought I'd just let you know. See you soon!",
	"Look at your friend, look. Look what you made me do! All that killing and plundering. I didn't mean to completely annihilate him, or burn the crops, and kill every child, but you made me. How does that feel?",
	"Can you believe it, your neighbouring {FACTION_RACE_LORD} tried to stop me from visiting you. I said, 'what are you, keeping good friends apart!' But he just wouldn't listen. I had to kill him so that we can be togeather. See you soon darling!",
],

HELP_FIGHT: [
	"{RACE_CURSE}! {HEC} attacked me! Can you believe that? What did you do to this guy? My army is blooded, the border regions lay in ruins, and it's all because of you! Thanks a bunch, {RACE_INSULT}!",
	"Since you didn't pay, I had to chase '{RAIDER_NAME}' off. I would appreciate if you would not drag me into your {RACE_INSULTING} business again. Some compensation for this odreal would be in order.",
	"Don't worry my {RACE_LORD}. You didn't pay me, but I took care of it. {RAIDER_NAME} barely escaped with {HIS} life. It was not very pleasant business though...",
],

REJECTED: [
	"You {RACE_INSULT}! You just passed up the opportunity of a lifetime. Well, now we have no choice but to pay your little {RACE_CITY} a visit in person.",
	"No stuff, no love from us. Remember, we warned you.",
	"Hello. You forgot to pay. Prepare to die.",
	"You, {RACE_SELF}, are nothing but a {RACE_INSULT}. Your subjects will pay dearly for this.",
	"Tomorrow, we will come and reap what you have built, {RACE_INSULT}. I will personally urinate on your throne. Until then...",
	"What you do not give willingly, we regret to inform that we must take by force.",
	"You {RACE_INSULT}! You have just crossed the wrong {RACE}! Prepare for our arrival, as in dig a hole to be buried in.",
	"You {RACE_INSULT} you... You have just crossed {RAIDER_NAME}. Prepare to meet {RELIGION_GOD}.",
],

PAYED: [
	"Good, good. One, two, three... yes it seems to be all there. It's been a pleasure doing business with my esteemed {RACE_LORD}. We will meet again no doubt, sooner than you may think. Make sure your stockpiles are filled to the brim until then. Ta ta!",
	"I'm glad you see reason, {FACTION_RACE_SELF}. No point in sulking over this, it's simply a redistribution of wealth. Now we {RACE_SELVES} must take our leave. Until next time!",
	"What is this crap you sent me {RACE_INSULT}, are you pulling my leg? Punishment awaits! No, sorry, forgive my {RACIAN} twisted sense of humour. It's all there, you have our thanks. We shall meet again. {RACE_GOODBYE}!",
	"Thanks for the stuff! {RACE_GOODBYE}!",
	"Lovely stuff, thanks! {RACE_GOODBYE}!",
	"Good, good. One, two, three... yes it seems to be all there. {RACE_GOODBYE}!",
	"{FACTION_RULER}, you have proven yourself a true {RACE_INSULT}. Good. {RACE_GOODBYE}!",
	"{RACE_CURSE} I never thought you'd pay. I was merely bluffing you see. Very well. {RACE_GOODBYE}",
],

AFTER_RAID: [
	"I do not enjoy killing {FACTION_RACES}. Well, maybe a little... Although, to it's hard work, and I kindly ask that you just pay up next time, my little {RACE_INSULT}",
	"{RACE_CURSE} Killing your {FACTION_RACES} {FACTION_RACE_SELVES} never gets old. When we come again, you must promise to put up more resistance.",
	"I did not enjoy that. Well maybe a little. However it cost me dearly, and I now have no other choice but to increase the cost of my services.",
	"{FACTION_RULER}, I hope now that you've learnt that you do not mess with the one and only {RAIDER_NAME}. Next time, do try to see reason.",
	"Next time, do the right thing for your {RACE_CITY} and your {FACTION_RACIAN} {FACTION_RACE_SELVES}. No need to be a hero.",
	"{RACE_INSULT}, see what you made me do? Countless {RACE_SELVES} lie dead because of you. Next time just pay up as the good little {FACTION_RACE} you are. Now get to work, I expect a bigger tribute next time. I will see you very soon.",
	"{RACE_HELLO} {FACTION_RACE_LORD}. It looks like I beat you. If it's any consolation, you put up a good fight. Next {RAIDER_NAME} arrive, make sure your stocks are full. {RACE_GOODBYE}.",
