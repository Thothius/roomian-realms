		The artifact that has been brought to you today looks like it could be a formidable weapon. It is mostly dark blue and has a conical shape, with a fine point. A spiraling pattern trails down the cone, and it rotates slowly, animated by something beyond your ken.
		At the cone base there is a handle, and a small lever, adorned with faintly glowing runes. Below the lever are runes, likely explaining the effects. The pointy part has some signs of wear, which have been caused by battle. The scratches show that the color is not just a coat of paint, but the natural coloration of this unknown material.

		Upon reaching the final markings, the artifact seems to gain a mind of its own and wrenches your arms to the side. The lever has become stuck, and after wrestling with it for a while, the thing escapes your grasp, falling onto the ground.
		 
		A cloud of dirt hits you. After it settles, you can make out a perfectly spherical hole. Determining the depth proves impossible; dropped torches disappear from view, and no impact can be heard. A long rope with a weight also failed to find the bottom.

		Major artifacts have to be brought to you, and you may claim them after offering a suitable reward, or demand your share in denari. Historically, rulers that grew too greedy just encouraged secret excavations.
  
  
		The artifact looks to be a bit plain at first glance, a dull grey, metal rod, with a variety of spurs lining it. It lacks any symbols of rulership, so it is unlikely to be a scepter, and small protrusions on one end are likely used to hold it upright.
		What makes it notable is that it takes a dozen of your subjects to move the rather small object into your throne room. After it was removed from its carrying harness and with great effort levered upright, something strange happens. 
		Nothing perceivable changed, but it looks dangerous now, as if it could spring into motion at any moment.
		Careful inspection reveals a set of three rings near the base, that look like they can slide to cover lines marked with ancient runes. The rings are currently all on the bottommost markings.

		Shifting the rings did not appear to do anything at first, but as the thinnest one brushed a marking near the middle, the rod changed. Touching its surface now left your hands numb.
		Unsure if that was a good sign, you continued. Unlike you had expected, you did not need to align all three rings, or perhaps you made a mistake, because as soon as the second one touched a certain marked line, the rod started to emit a shrill whine, and started shaking.
		 
		After relocating to a presumably safe distance, you watch as the the shaking grew more violent, but inexplicably the artifact did not fall over. 
		Finally, as the shrill noise in the air reached a crescendo, the rod grew still, the noise stopped, and a wave of force swept you off your feet. 
		 
		Besides some minor damage to nearby vegetation, that seems to have been all it did though. The rings you used to manipulate the artifact have fused with it, and will not budge, and the rod emits a burnt smell. It seems to be broken.
		On your way to your city, you notice a slight difference. Something about the sky has changed, but what exactly eludes you.",
