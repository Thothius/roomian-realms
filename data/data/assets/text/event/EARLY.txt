	MESSAGE: [
		"Something big broke into your meat storage, and ate or befouled about half of it. While your villagers will secure the storage rooms better from now on, there is the matter of whether or not you want to send out some hunters after the mysterious animal.
		 
		Judging by the destruction, this could be a very dangerous task, but hunting it down would likely stock up your diminished food reserves.",

		"The bravest villagers volunteered themselves, and followed the tracks the beast had left. An animal of that size, that did not care about obscuring its tracks made your hunters nervous, but they eventually tracked it down. 
		
		It was a half-wild Entelodont of monstrous proportions. 
		
		Unfortunately, the hunt did not go smoothly, and some villagers never made it back. The survivors did not offer any details, but the bloody tusks of the beast spoke for themselves.",
