When asked about side effects, she rapidly lists an impressive amount of them but none of them should be impacting their work. Well, some of them will die from the first dose due to incompatibility, but you are assured that the chance is rather low. Buying her stock should allow you to increase slave submission and productivity for a full year.
		
		This particular merchant does not have strong ties to nearby factions and is a relative unknown. You could capture her to make a statement about the usage of drugs like this. While that may have a lasting impact on how your slaves view you and their lot in life, you will not be able to receive similar offers in the future.",
