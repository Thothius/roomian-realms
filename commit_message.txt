Version 0.52: Race Enhancement Patch v1

- Standardized race sizes into three distinct groups for better gameplay balance:
  - Small Races: Wormlings and Froggians (Height 5, Width 5)
  - Medium Races: Satyrs, Bloodelves, Pasunkas, and Northmen (Height 7, Width 7)
  - Large Races: Finestorians and Hellspawn (Height 9, Width 9)
  
- Rebalanced adult maturation ages based on race size:
  - Smaller races reach adulthood faster (Froggians: 60 days)
  - Medium races have moderate maturation periods (80-90 days)
  - Larger races develop more slowly (110-120 days)
  - Wormlings remain unique with extremely rapid maturation (15 days)

- Updated documentation in README.md to reflect these changes
- Updated version number to 0.52 in _Info.txt
