# RoomianRealms v0.8

## Overview
In the shadow of fallen empires, eight ancient bloodlines vie for dominance across a realm where forgotten gods still whisper. RoomianRealms transforms Songs of Syx into a theater of ambition, betrayal, and ancient power where your choices will echo through generations. Choose your lineage wisely, for each carries both blessing and curse from the world that came before.

## The Bloodlines

### Children of Light
Those who walk in daylight, bearing the burden of conscience. Their power comes not from dominance but from harmony—yet even the brightest light casts the darkest shadows. Behind their peaceful façades lie ancient secrets and rituals performed under moonlight or within sacred pools.

### Heirs of Balance
Neither blessed nor cursed, these bloodlines forge their own destiny through steel, craft, and discipline. They stand between light and darkness, pragmatic survivors whose traditions honor the fallen creators. Their strength lies in tradition, honor, and the wisdom to know when both must be set aside.

### Servants of Shadow
Those who embraced the whispers of fallen gods, gaining terrible power at terrible cost. Their societies built upon suffering and domination, they see mercy as weakness and compassion as folly. Yet even in darkness, purpose and order can be found—twisted though they may be.

### The Outsiders
Neither of this world nor fully separate from it, they move between realities with unknowable purpose. Ancient beyond reckoning, their true nature lies hidden behind masks of flesh. They remember what came before and what lies beyond—knowledge that would shatter mortal minds.
