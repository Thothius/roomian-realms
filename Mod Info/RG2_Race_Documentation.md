### Lore Summary
The Wormlings are cosmic horrors from beyond reality who arrived through "The Breach" when a strange celestial body crashed into Syx's primordial swamps. Originally serving the God-Emperor of the Endless Void in their home dimension, they now exist as collective hive organisms—thousands of specialized worms that infest and transform humanoid hosts.

Their settlements are built around sacred Nutrient Pools where their young gestate and the revered Great Worms dwell, connecting all Wormlings through a psychic network. They believe in "The Great Renewal," a cosmic cycle of parasitic consumption that will eventually encompass all life, with the ultimate goal of recreating The Breach in reverse to return to their home dimension.

The Wormlings worship Shmalor with fanatical devotion, believing her divine essence became the First Great Worm. Their society is structured around five specialized castes: Infiltrators, Digesters, Cultivators, Connectors, and Rememberers. Despite their horrifying nature, they maintain complex diplomatic relations with other civilizations, viewing most as potential hosts.

### Gameplay Strategy
Wormlings excel at rapid population growth and agricultural production. Their extremely short lifespan is offset by their exceptional reproduction rate, allowing them to quickly recover from disasters. They are best suited for agricultural settlements with a focus on Balti pastures and void technology. Their poor mining and crafting abilities should be supplemented by other civilizations or slaves.

Their unique racial building, the Nutrient Pool, allows them to process organic matter efficiently while their connection to the void makes them the premier civilization for harnessing void energies through the Void Gateway and its Void Communion mode.

### Lore Summary
The Bloodelves trace their origins to the First War of the Gods, when Aminion's dark essence transformed forest dwellers into beings who sustain themselves through blood consumption. Their hunting prowess is unmatched, with the ability to track prey for days without rest and ambush with enchanted longbows. Their combat doctrine, the "Path of Crimson Shadows," teaches that true power flows from blood freely given or violently taken.

Their society is strictly hierarchical, with status determined by blood magic potency and victim lineage. The highest echelon, the Sanguine Court, consists of ancient Bloodelves who have consumed the blood of legendary heroes and kings, granting them extended lifespans and formidable magical abilities.

Their settlements are architectural marvels hidden in ancient forests, built around massive "Heartwood Trees" fed with blood sacrifices. These trees produce crimson sap that enhances their abilities when consumed during the monthly Crimson Moon ritual. Their most sacred site, the Cathedral of Crimson Mists, houses an eternal flame burning with the combined blood of a thousand civilizations.

The Bloodelves maintain complex relationships with other civilizations, viewing Hellspawns as kindred spirits in darkness and respecting Finestorians' craftsmanship while disdaining the peaceful ways of Froggians and Satyrs. They primarily worship Aminion with blood sacrifices while maintaining secondary reverence for Shmalor, whom they believe taught them blood magic.

### Gameplay Strategy
Bloodelves excel at ranged combat, hunting, and intellectual pursuits. Their extended lifespan makes them excellent administrators and researchers, while their hunting prowess ensures a steady supply of meat. They struggle with agriculture and basic resource gathering, making them dependent on slaves or other civilizations for these tasks.

Their unique racial building, the Blood Ritual Chamber, allows them to perform blood rituals that enhance their abilities and stave off the Withering, a degenerative condition that afflicts their kind. They are best suited for settlements with a focus on hunting, archery, and scholarly pursuits, with a strong emphasis on slave management.
