   - Consider weapon specializations (blunt, slash, pierce)
   - Examples:
     - Finestorians: Strong with blunt weapons, good defense
     - Humans: Balanced combat abilities
     - Tilapi: Fast, good with ranged weapons
     - Garthimi: Unusual combat style, arena fighters

5. ENVIRONMENTAL ADAPTATION
   - Climate preferences should match racial lore
   - Terrain preferences affect settlement patterns
   - Consider special traits like AMPHIBIOUS for unique gameplay
   - Examples:
     - Finestorians: Mountain dwellers, cold-resistant
     - Humans: Prefer open terrain, temperate climate
     - Tilapi: Forest dwellers
     - Q_Amevia: Amphibious, prefer wet terrain

6. GROWTH AND EXPANSION
   - Higher GROWTH and IMMIGRATION_RATE for faster expansion
   - Lower values for slower, more controlled growth
   - Balance with MAX population to prevent overpowering
   - Examples:
     - Garthimi: Very high growth rate (0.2) but limited acceptance
     - Humans: Moderate growth (0.075) with good immigration
     - Finestorians: Slow growth but steady

7. COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER RACES
   - Values below 0.5 create tension and conflict
   - Values above 0.5 promote harmony
   - Consider historical relationships in lore
   - Examples:
     - Tilapi: Hostile to humans and Finestorians (0.0)
     - Humans: Generally accepting of most races (0.75)
     - Garthimi: Extremely xenophobic (0.02) except to a few races

8. UNIQUE RACIAL IDENTITY
   - Each race should have distinctive strengths and weaknesses
   - Avoid making any race superior in all aspects
   - Create meaningful trade-offs in abilities
   - Examples:
     - Finestorians: Excellent crafters but poor farmers
     - Humans: Good at education but shorter lifespan
     - Tilapi: Fast and good hunters but poor miners
     - Q_Amevia: Intellectual but physically weaker
