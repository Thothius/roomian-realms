# RoomianRealms (v0.4)

## Overview

*"Eight extraordinary civilizations emerge from the ashes of a shattered world. From mystical forest guardians to technological amphibians, each society has forged its own path through the chaos of divine conflict."*

When ancient powers clashed, they left behind a tapestry of diverse culturesâ€”each shaped by their connection to forgotten deities. Now these inheritors of divine wisdom and arcane knowledge vie for supremacy across fractured lands. The future belongs to those who can unite these disparate peoples or bend their unique strengths to their will.
