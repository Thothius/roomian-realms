# RoomianRealms (v0.55)

### The Shattering

The current age was born from **The Shattering**, a cataclysm triggered when the **Chronoworm**, a colossal, reality-bending entity from another plane, tore through the fabric of the realms. This violent intrusion fractured the world and extinguished several of the ancient **Astari** gods, including **Bardok** (mentioned as defeated by Athuri) and the powerful **Shmalor**, whose void essence dissolved into potent, corrupting energy.

The surviving Astari—**Athuri** (Wisdom & Harmony), **Crator** (Creation & Order), and **Aminion** (Chaos & Destruction)—along with the enigmatic **Shmalor** (now known primarily as the Trickster, embodying Cunning & Opportunity), struggled to impose their wills on the fractured reality.

The Chronoworm's passage left an indelible scar: **void residue**, the lingering essence of the fallen aspect of Shmalor, now infused within the common **Sithilon Ore**. This ore, pulsating with transformative power, became a focal point for the eight surviving civilizations—Satyrs, Froggians, Northmen, Pasunkas, Wormlings, Bloodelves, Finestorians, and Hellspawn. Each race seeks to harness its potential, navigating a world forever changed by the echo of the void and the shifting balance of the remaining gods.

### Divine Powers

- **The Fallen One (Aminion)** - Lord of chaos who rebelled against the cosmic order. Once a powerful Astari, Aminion sought to remake reality in his own image. Primarily worshipped by Hellspawns and Bloodelves.

- **The Leader (Athuri)** - Greatest of the Astari, who embodies wisdom, harmony, and the natural order. Defeated his brother Bardok in both cosmic wars, establishing balance in the world. Primarily worshipped by Satyrs and Froggians.

- **The Creator (Crator)** - Divine Architect and foremost creator among the Astari, who shaped the physical world and its many creatures. His temples celebrate craftsmanship, discipline, and the perfection of form. Primarily worshipped by Pasunkas and Finestorians.

- **The Slain Queen (Shmalor)** - Queen of the Agonosh, who represents the cosmic void and the spaces between realities. Slain during the first war of the gods, her death tore the veil between dimensions. Primarily worshipped by Wormlings.

- **The God Emperor** - An alien entity from beyond reality that entered Roomia through The Breach created by Shmalor's death.

The Wormlings contain fragments of its essence, allowing them to perceive multiple realities simultaneously. The ultimate goal of its worship is transcendence - preparing Roomia for the God Emperor's eventual return.
