# Roomian Realms (RG2)

## Overview

*"Eight ancient bloodlines vie for dominance in a world where forgotten gods still whisper. Forge your legacy through blood, steel, or forbidden knowledge as ancient pacts are broken and new alliances forged."*

When the old gods fell, they left behind their childrenâ€”some blessed, others cursed. Now these heirs to divinity and darkness clash across a fractured realm where honor and treachery are merely different faces of survival. The throne awaits one who can master the delicate dance of power.
