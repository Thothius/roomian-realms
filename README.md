# RoomianRealms

## Overview

*"Eight distinct civilizations vie for supremacy in a fractured world. From mystical forest dwellers to parasitic hive minds, each culture brings unique strengths, philosophies, and ancient traditions to the battlefield."*

When the old gods fell, they left behind diverse peoplesâ€”some blessed with wisdom and harmony, others twisted by darkness and ambition. These heirs to divine legacies now forge their own paths across a realm where honor, treachery, mysticism, and pragmatism shape the destiny of nations. The throne awaits one who can harness the rich tapestry of cultures to master the delicate dance of power.
