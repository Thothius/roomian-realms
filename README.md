# RoomianRealms (v0.55)

### The Shattering

The current age was born from **The Shattering**, a cataclysm triggered when the **Chronoworm**, a colossal, reality-bending entity from another plane, tore through the fabric of the realms. This violent intrusion fractured the world and extinguished several of the ancient **Astari** gods, including **Bardok** (mentioned as defeated by Athuri) and the powerful **Shmalor**, whose essence dissolved into potent, corrupting energy.

The surviving Astari—**Athuri** (Wisdom & Harmony), **Crator** (Creation & Order), and **Aminion** (Chaos & Destruction)—along with the enigmatic **Shmalor** (or what's left of him), struggled to impose their wills on the fractured reality.

The Chronoworm's passage left an indelible scar: **void residue**, the lingering essence of the fallen aspect of Shmalor, now infused within the common **Sithilon Ore**. This ore, pulsating with transformative power, became a focal point for the eight surviving civilizations—Satyrs, Froggians, Northmen, Pasunkas, Wormlings, Bloodelves, Finestorians, and Hellspawn. Each race seeks to harness its potential, navigating a world forever changed by the echo of the void and the shifting balance of the remaining gods.

### Divine Powers

The Roomian Realms are influenced by the remaining Astari gods, each representing fundamental forces:

| Aminion (The Fallen One) | Athuri (The Leader) |
| :----------------------: | :-----------------: |
| ![Aminion](docs/assets/backgrounds/misc_001.png) | ![Athuri](docs/assets/backgrounds/misc_002.png) |
| Lord of Chaos. Once a powerful Astari, he embraced destruction and now seeks to twist reality to his will. Worshipped primarily by **Hellspawns** and **Bloodelves**, who value power gained through suffering and domination. | Embodiment of Wisdom and Harmony. Athuri fought to preserve balance during the cosmic wars and represents the natural order and the pursuit of knowledge. Worshipped primarily by **Satyrs** and **Froggians**, who seek alignment with nature and collective understanding. |

| Crator (The Creator) | Shmalor (The Shattered One / The Trickster) |
| :------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
| ![Crator](docs/assets/backgrounds/misc_003.png) | ![Shmalor](docs/assets/backgrounds/misc_004.png) |
| The Divine Architect. Crator shaped the physical realm and embodies the principles of creation, order, and the perfection of form through discipline and skill. Worshipped primarily by **Pasunkas** and **Finestorians**, who value mastery, structure, and craftsmanship. Revered also by **Northmen** for blessing their shipbuilding and weapon-forging. | Represents the duality of the Void and Cunning. The original **Void God** aspect of Shmalor was destroyed during **The Shattering**, its essence dissolving into the **void residue** now sought by the **Wormlings**. However, an enigmatic **Trickster** aspect survived, embodying opportunity, adaptation, and manipulation. This aspect is revered by **Northmen** (for success in trade and cunning strategy) and **Bloodelves** (for political maneuvering and exploiting weakness). |
