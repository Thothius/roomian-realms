# RoomianRealms (v0.5)

## Overview

*"Eight extraordinary civilizations emerge from the ashes of a shattered world. From mystical forest guardians to technological amphibians, each society has forged its own path through the chaos of divine conflict."*

When ancient powers clashed, they left behind a tapestry of diverse culturesâ€”each shaped by their connection to forgotten deities. Now these inheritors of divine wisdom and arcane knowledge vie for supremacy across fractured lands. The future belongs to those who can unite these disparate peoples or bend their unique strengths to their will.

### Divine Powers

- **The Fallen One (Aminion)** - Lord of chaos who rebelled against the cosmic order. Once a powerful Astari, Aminion sought to remake reality in his own image. Primarily worshipped by Hellspawns and Bloodelves.

- **The Leader (Athuri)** - Greatest of the Astari, who embodies wisdom, harmony, and the natural order. Defeated his brother Bardok in both cosmic wars, establishing balance in the world. Primarily worshipped by Satyrs and Froggians.

- **The Creator (Crator)** - Divine Architect and foremost creator among the Astari, who shaped the physical world and its many creatures. His temples celebrate craftsmanship, discipline, and the perfection of form. Primarily worshipped by Pasunkas and Finestorians.

- **The Slain Queen (Shmalor)** - Queen of the Agonosh, who represents the cosmic void and the spaces between realities. Slain during the first war of the gods, her death tore the veil between dimensions. Primarily worshipped by Wormlings.

- **The God Emperor** - An alien entity from beyond reality that entered Roomia through the breach created by Shmalor's death. Unlike the other deities who were once gods of Roomia, the God Emperor is an extradimensional presence whose consciousness exists primarily in the void between dimensions. The Wormlings contain fragments of its essence, allowing them to perceive multiple realities simultaneously. The ultimate goal of its worship is transcendence - preparing Roomia for the God Emperor's eventual return.

### Character Traits System

The mod features a comprehensive trait system with:

- **Race-Specific Traits**: Each race has unique traits that reflect their cultural and biological characteristics
- **Elite Traits**: Rare and powerful traits with very low occurrence rates (0.5-1.5%)
- **Void-Related Traits**: Special traits that enhance interaction with Void technology
- **Balanced Distribution**: Traits are distributed appropriately based on race population sizes
- **Mutual Exclusivity**: Thematically opposite traits cannot be possessed simultaneously
