The Shattered Realms of Roomia
The Shattering
The Time Worm tore through Roomia, killing the gods and fracturing reality itself. In the aftermath, the realm lies in chaos, with eight distinct races emerging from the ruins of divine influence. Each race carries the weight of their past and the struggle for survival in a world now defined by void oreâ€”fragments of power that hold the potential for both creation and destruction.

The Eight Races
1. Satyrs
Wild and free, the Satyrs dwell in the forests, embracing both the beauty and brutality of nature. Their matriarchal society values wisdom and ritual, with the Wild Hunt serving as a sacred connection to their lost gods.

2. Froggians
Peaceful and diplomatic, the Froggians navigate the waters of Roomia with grace. They form councils of wisdom, seeking harmony and understanding, but their pacifism is often tested by the chaos around them.

3. Bloodelves
Aristocratic and cruel, the Bloodelves revel in blood magic and the power it grants. Their society thrives on hierarchy and sacrifice, drawing strength from the fear they instill in others.

4. Hellspawn
Demonic and chaotic, the Hellspawn embody destruction and suffering. They seek to dominate through pain, viewing the world as a battleground where only the strongest survive.

5. Wormlings
Alien and hive-minded, the Wormlings emerged from the void, seeking to transform reality itself. They believe in a cosmic cycle of consumption and rebirth, driven by their connection to the God Emperor.

6. Northmen
Pragmatic and resilient, the Northmen adapt to the harshness of their environment. They balance trade and warfare, worshipping the divine architect Crator while navigating the complexities of their world.

7. Pasunkas
Disciplined and meditative, the Pasunkas strive for balance in all things. Their society emphasizes harmony and efficiency, following the teachings of Crator to restore order amidst chaos.

8. Finestorians
Master craftsmen, the Finestorians dedicate their lives to creation and precision. They believe that through their artistry, they can rebuild the world and honor the lost gods.

The Age of Void
With the discovery of void ore, the races of Roomia are drawn into a struggle for power and dominance. This precious resource fuels technological advancements and magical innovations, but it also ignites conflict as each race vies for control.

As alliances shift and enmities deepen, the fate of Roomia hangs in the balance. Will the fractured races unite to restore what was lost, or will they succumb to the chaos of their shattered world?
